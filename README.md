This is a remake of the classical arcade game "Space Invaders" with modern 3D graphics and some special features like power-ups,
XBox 360 controller support and even an intro video. Its original hosting site is on
[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/studi-invaders/) and this serves as a mirror.
